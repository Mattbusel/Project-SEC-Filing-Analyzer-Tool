Financial Data Anomaly Detection and Forecasting
Project Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to analyze financial data, detect anomalies, and forecast future trends. Using a variety of models from scikit-learn, such as RandomForestRegressor, KMeans, and IsolationForest, the model is designed to predict financial performance and detect outliers or anomalous data points. The project focuses on leveraging Python, data science, and machine learning to build a robust system for financial data analysis.

Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes Random Forest Regressor for forecasting future financial trends based on historical data.
Anomaly Detection: Applies Isolation Forest to identify outliers and anomalies in financial datasets, helping in risk assessment.
Clustering: Implements KMeans clustering to group financial data, making it easier to understand patterns and trends in large datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Tools:
scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor, IsolationForest, KMeans, train_test_split)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
Data Sources
The project uses historical financial data (specific data sources can be included if applicable, or you can mention if it's synthetic data generated for the project).
Installation
To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-anomaly-detection.git
cd financial-anomaly-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
How It Works
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load financial data from CSV or any other data format.
Handle missing values and normalize features for model training.
Model Training:

Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Train the Random Forest Regressor model to predict future financial trends.
Use KMeans clustering to identify and group similar data points.
Anomaly Detection:

Train the Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies and outliers in financial data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE).
Visualize the clustering results and anomalies detected.
Example Usage
Provide a simple script or example of how to use the project:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')

# Preprocessing steps...
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate...
Results
Provide details on the model performance, such as accuracy, RÂ² score, or any other evaluation metric used.
You can also include a visualization showing the clustering results or the anomalies detected in the dataset.
Future Enhancements
Extend the project to use more advanced deep learning models (e.g., neural networks for time series forecasting).
Implement real-time financial data monitoring and anomaly detection.
Integrate with an external API to pull live financial data.
