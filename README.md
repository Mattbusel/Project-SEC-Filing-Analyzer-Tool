# Financial Data Anomaly Detection and Forecasting

---

### Overview

This project develops a robust machine learning pipeline to **analyze financial data**, **detect anomalies**, and **forecast future trends**. It combines classic statistical models with modern ML techniques, focusing on risk identification and actionable insights.

---

### 🔍 Key Features

- **📈 Predictive Modeling**  
  Utilizes `RandomForestRegressor` to forecast financial performance based on historical data.

- **🚨 Anomaly Detection**  
  Implements `IsolationForest` to flag outliers and irregular patterns, supporting proactive risk mitigation.

- **🔗 Pattern Recognition via Clustering**  
  Leverages `KMeans` to uncover natural groupings and relationships within complex financial datasets.

- **🧹 Intelligent Preprocessing**  
  Handles missing values, scales features, and engineers variables to enhance model fidelity.

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - `scikit-learn` (RandomForestRegressor, IsolationForest, KMeans)
  - `pandas` for data wrangling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- **Data:** Historical financial data or synthetic datasets (can be adjusted per use case)

---

### 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-anomaly-detection.git
cd financial-anomaly-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚙️ How It Works

#### 1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
- Load data from `.csv` or custom source
- Handle missing values
- Normalize and transform features

#### 2. **Model Training**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### 3. **Clustering**
- Use `KMeans` to segment similar financial behaviors

#### 4. **Anomaly Detection**
- Apply `IsolationForest` to uncover rare or suspicious data points

#### 5. **Evaluation**
- Assess performance using RMSE, MAE, R², etc.
- Visualize cluster distributions and flagged anomalies

### 📌 Results

- Forecast accuracy: ~XX% (adjust based on evaluation metrics)
- Number of anomalies detected: XYZ
- Clear differentiation between normal and outlier behavior

---

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Transition from classical ML to **deep learning** models (e.g., LSTMs or Transformers for time series)
- Build **real-time data pipelines** using tools like Apache Kafka or Airflow
- Connect to live financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud)
- Deploy anomaly alerts via webhooks or Slack bots
